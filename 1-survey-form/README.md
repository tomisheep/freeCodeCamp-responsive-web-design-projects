This is the first project of the freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. The project focuses on creating a simple survey form with requested features such as a dropdown menu, select function, radio buttons, and checkboxes. Throughout the project, I learned several key concepts and skills essential for web development. Key things I learned:

1. HTML Structure and Semantics:
   * Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document, including elements such as head, body, and footer.
   * Using semantic elements like form, label, input, and textarea to create a meaningful and accessible form structure.
   * Adding things like Google Fonts integration, adding images and understanding of meta elements.

2. Form Elements:
   * Implementing various form elements including text inputs, email inputs, number inputs, dropdown menus, radio buttons, and checkboxes.
   * Understanding the importance of attributes like id, name, type, placeholder, required, min, and max for proper form functionality and validation.
  
3. CSS Styling:
   * Applying CSS to style the form and ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
   * Utilizing different CSS properties such as background, border, padding, margin, font-family, and color to enhance the design.
   * Implementing responsive design principles to ensure the form looks good on various devices and screen sizes.
   * I spent a lot of time figuring out the best practices on how to use the linear-gradient function to create a pleasing view to the eye. This can be seen in most of the elements within the project.
  
4. Layout Techniques:
   * Using CSS to manage the layout of form elements, including aligning elements, setting widths, and using margins for spacing.
   * Understanding the use of flexbox and grid layout techniques to create flexible and adaptive form layouts.
  
Also: Learning the importance of accessible web design, including using labels for form inputs and ensuring all elements are reachable and usable via keyboard navigation. 

Overall, this project provided a solid foundation in creating web forms, understanding HTML and CSS, and considering user experience and accessibility in web design. It laid the groundwork for more complex projects and helped build confidence in using the fundamental tools and techniques of web development.
