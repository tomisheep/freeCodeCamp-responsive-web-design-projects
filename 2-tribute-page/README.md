This is the second project of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. The project is about creating a tribute page. Through this project and the exercises before it, I learned a lot of important web design basics, including:

1. CSS Box Model:

* I got to know how the CSS box model works to design and position elements on a web page. This includes understanding how content, padding, border, and margin work together to affect the size and layout of elements.

2. Flexbox:

* I learned about Flexbox, which helps in making layouts more flexible and easier to manage. I practiced using properties like justify-content, align-items, flex-direction, and flex-wrap to create responsive and adaptable designs.

3. Typography:

* I explored typography, focusing on choosing the right fonts, setting font sizes, line heights, and letter spacing to make text look good and be easy to read. I also learned about using web-safe fonts and adding Google Fonts to the project.

4. Accessibility:

* I focused on making sure the web content is accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. This involved using semantic HTML elements, aria attributes for screen readers, ensuring good color contrast, and making the site easy to navigate with a keyboard.
